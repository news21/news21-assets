						<h2>Production</h2>
						<p>Cattle are transferred from grazing ranges to feedlots once they weigh 650 pounds. Their diet is 95 percent grain, which lowers stomach acidity and puts the animals’ health at risk. The cattle are given antibiotics to keep them alive long enough to reach slaughter weight.</p>

						<p>They are fed from troughs raised off the ground, where contamination can occur. Diseases can spread through animal-to-animal contact. Cattle are raised outdoors, and the winter rains bring a greater risk of mud and feces becoming caked in the cow’s hair.</p>

						<h2>Harvest</h2>
            <p>Once cattle are stunned (by electric shock or a stunbolt),  the animals’ carotid arteries and jugular veins are severed, causing death from blood loss. The head and feet are removed. Before  hide is removed, care is taken to cut around the digestive tract to prevent fecal contamination later in the process.</p>
            <p>Carcasses are chilled to kill and prevent microorganisms and to reduce spoilage prior to distribution. The carcass is inspected by workers from the Food Safety and Inspection Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and subject to different methods used to reduce levels of bacteria. USDA-regulated meat-handling facilities must have a FSIS inspector present during working hours.</p>

						<h2>Processing</h2>
						<p>After chilling, beef is broken down into different cuts for boxed meat.  Carcasses are always split in half and quartered. The remaining carcass may be further processed to extract residual traces of meat, which may be used for human or animal consumption. Ground beef may be packed in different ways depending on the buyer. Some stores and supermarkets grind their own beef, while others have a central meat-cutting location.</p>

						<p>Workers break down and clean all the equipment at least once a day. Many plants run two shifts and then clean. When workers go on break, they spray equipment with hot water.</p>

						<h2>Distribution</h2>
						<p>Large companies have their own fleets, while smaller companies hire trucks.

					<div>
						<h2>Consumption</h2>
						<p>Ground beef has a shorter shelf life than whole-muscle cuts. The inside of a steak is sterile because it has not been exposed to air and contaminants, while ground beef, mixed up in the grinding process, is not sterile. Also, oxygen and water from broken muscle cells have been added during the process, which can introduce contamination and result in loss of flavor and nutritional quality.</p>
						<p>The risk in preparing ground beef is cross-contamination with other foods. Prepare anything you’re eating raw (salad, etc.) first. Cook the meat last. Vigorously wash utensils used in preparing the raw meat and clean all surfaces that came in contact with the meat. Cook all ground beef thoroughly.</p>

						<h2>Production</h2>
						<p>The offspring of a small group of pedigreed birds lay eggs that are sent to hatcheries. After the eggs hatch, the chicks are sent to broiler farms. Contract growers raise them according to poultry company standards, but each farmer determines specific practices.</p> 
						<p> On the farm, chickens are kept in houses that protect them from the elements, wild animals and insects. Rats, mice, bugs and birds carry pathogens into the farms, and growers use pesticides and traps to keep them out. Heat and chemical treatments are used to prevent microbial growth in the wood chips and feces that line the floors of the houses.</p>

				<p>Farmers purchase hens from breeders, who are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to monitor them for salmonella. The FDA has limited resources to check compliance. Hens typically are housed in so-called high-rise facilities, with rows of cages stacked on top of each other. Hens eat from narrow troughs that hang on the outside of their cages. Rodents can infect feed by leaving bacteria-laden droppings in troughs. The FDA requires that hen houses trap rodents and keep records of the number of dead rodents. In newer hen houses, a manure belt runs beneath each row of cages to remove waste. But many facilities lack manure belts.</p>

If an egg breaks, it can attract rodents or spread bacteria to the shells of other eggs. According to FDA rules, eggs must be refrigerated within 36 hours of production. At room temperature, cells of salmonella can rapidly multiply.</p>

				<h2>Processing</h2>
				<p>After transport from farm to processing facility, eggs are washed with soap and water to remove dirt and manure. Salmonella can breed in the wash water if it is too acidic. Workers then package eggs in cartons and move them to loading docks, which are not usually refrigerated, and load them on refrigerated trucks.</p>

				<h2>Production</h2>
				<p>Once they mature in hatcheries, farm-raised shrimp are transferred to nurseries or directly to farms that hold them in ponds or tanks for several months until they are harvested with large nets. The diet of shrimp consists primarily of algae or commercial feed. In some countries, like China and Vietnam, the water may be fertilized with human waste and animal manure to promote the growth of algae. The use of untreated waste can cause bacterial growth and promote the spread of pathogens like salmonella. International shrimp farms also often use veterinary drugs and antibiotics that may or may not be legal in the U.S.</p>

				<h2>Processing</h2>
				<p>Shrimp can be delivered in many forms like breaded and processed or frozen, raw or pre-cooked. Typically, they are delivered to a processing facility and peeled and deveined in large machines. If they are going to be cooked before distribution, they are boiled in tanks, sorted and inspected. Whether or not shrimp are processed, peeled or frozen before distribution, temperature and time are the chief concerns. If not chilled, frozen, thawed or boiled at the proper temperature and time, shrimp can spoil easily, and pathogens can survive on the product.</p>

			<div>
				<h2>Import</h2>
				<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is responsible for overseeing the import of all shrimp products, 90 percent of which come from out of the country. Shrimp was the seafood product with the most shipments denied entry into the country in the past decade, accounting for nearly 22 percent of seafood refusals in the FDA import refusal records from 2002 to 2010. The top two reasons shrimp were denied entry during this period were "filth" and salmonella.</p>

				<h2>Distribution</h2>
				<p>Before shrimp are distributed, they are often put in oxygen-free packages to protect the product from spoilage. Whole shrimp will stay good in a temperature of minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit for six months and will keep longer if frozen in a block of ice. When distributed to retailers, they are kept in refrigerated trucks, and maintaining the temperature in these vehicles is vital to maintaining the quality of the shrimp.</p>

				<h2>Consumption</h2>
				<p>Perhaps the most effective way to prevent foodborne illness involving shrimp is during preparation. In restaurants and homes, preventing cross-contamination and cooking at high enough temperatures are essential in destroying any pathogens. As with all food preparation, cooks should thoroughly wash their hands and disinfect preparation areas before preparing shrimp. Seafood should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees, according to the FDA. If not thoroughly cooked, shrimp pose risks because they often carry pathogens.</p>

				<h2>Production</h2>
				<p>Before strawberry seedlings, grown in nurseries, are planted in the field, the soil is shaped into raised beds and covered in plastic sheeting. Holes where the seedlings will be planted are punched into the plastic. The plastic creates a barrier between the top of the plant that bears fruit and the soil. This avoids moisture buildup, which can create rot or soft spots susceptible to pathogen growth, and prevents microbial contamination. Irrigation water is tested for potential contamination from polluted runoff that may carry E. coli.

				<p>Alfalfa sprout seeds come from all over the world. If pathogens are found in full-grown sprouts, they were probably present in the seed. Even if salmonella or E. coli levels in seeds are minimal, the moist conditions in which they grow allow the pathogens to multiply easily.</p>
				<p>Seeds are sanitized in a calcium hypochlorite solution for 10 minutes and rinsed for 15 minutes. This can help reduce pathogens but won't eliminate them. The grower puts seeds in plastic trays with a thin layer of water where they sprout for six to seven days. Sprouts are sprayed with water every four hours.

Many fields have strict sanitation rules requiring workers to wear gloves to ensure that their skin does not come into contact with plants. While still at the field, peppers are wiped off and packed into bulk bins or trailers for transport to a packing facility.</p>

				<h2>Processing</h2>
				<p>Some operations sort and pack peppers in the field; others immediately send them to a packing house where peppers are washed and cleaned with brushes to remove dirt and residue from the field. They are dried, graded by size and condition and sorted. Packing houses are subject to inspection by city, county, state, federal and third-party inspectors. The standard unit of sale is a carton holding approximately 26 to 28 pounds. Some growers of specialty bell peppers pack them in smaller cartons.</p>

				<h2>Distribution</h2>
				<p>To improve post-harvest quality, peppers are cooled before shipment or storage by chilled water (before packing) or forced-air (after packing). Peppers are sensitive to freezing below 45 degrees. Typical transportation and storage conditions are 45 to 55 degrees with high humidity (90 to 95 percent).</p>

				<h2>Consumption</h2>
				<p>Consumers should wash peppers to prevent cross-contamination. Peppers remain suitable for consumption for up to 15 days after harvest. General signs of damage to peppers include softening, discoloration and shriveling.</p>
